This is one of the trickiest features to obtain, as common sources only have short histories of intraday data (Bloomberg typically houses about 6months worth of intraday data). However, for the purpose of the model, several years are needed. \n","\n","We source the intraday data from the TAQ database of Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), and the code requires a login credentials. \n","\n","The code proceeds in two steps. The first one downloads to separate csv files the relevant intraday trades for several years (one at a time, given query size) while at the same time resampling it to a 1-minute frequency. The second step loads all of these csv files, merges them together and calculates a continues time series of mean intraday correlation, which is outputed as a separate csv file to be used as a feature."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bGCjQ5oegZQP"},"source":["#Setup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o8kAARukgbP3"},"source":["## Load Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":552,"status":"ok","timestamp":1650501204486,"user":{"displayName":"Rodrigo Erices","userId":"17126622163547033836"},"user_tz":240},"id":"o49_hDxKi0NF"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YyJQeMVUi0NJ"},"source":["## Download SPY/IEF Data from WRDS (Optional)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n2je19wrgmIh"},"source":["This section is only required once to generate raw csv collection.
